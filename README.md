# Notebook of RNA-Seq analysis using DIGGER

Applying DIGGER mode: network-level analysis to the RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer dataset. Using the structure annotation of isoforms and their expression level, DIGGER constructs a condition-specific PPI.


## Data Sources
- The transcript expressions using RNAseq were obtained from [the Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer dataset](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/). 

- The [BioMart](https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) tool was used to annotate and to map genes, transcripts and proteins.
